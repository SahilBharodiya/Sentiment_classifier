# Sentiment_classifier
I made a sample machine learning model with scikit learn 
Model is 91% accurate because I used 4 lacs reviews.
You have to run code only once after that model is saved in pickle file and just load it.
Model gives you a sentiment POSITIVE or NEGATIVE according to entered query.
